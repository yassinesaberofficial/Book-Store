How Hades kidnapped Persephone to be his bride. How her mother, Demeter, was so distraught she caused the Earth to start dying. \nThe real story is much more interesting. \nPersephone wasn\'t taken to hell: she jumped. There was no way she was going to be married off to some smug god more in love with himself than her. \nNow all she has to do is convince the Underworld\'s annoyingly sexy, arrogant and frankly rude ruler, Hades, to fall in line with her plan.

Across the Western world, museums display the spoils of war, of conquest, of colonialism: priceless pieces of art looted from other countries, kept even now. \nWill Chen plans to steal them back. \nA senior at Harvard, Will fits comfortably in his carefully curated roles: a perfect student, an art history major and sometimes artist, the eldest son who has always been his parents\' American Dream. But when a mysterious Chinese benefactor reaches out with an impossible—and illegal—job offer, Will finds himself something else as well: the leader of a heist to steal back five priceless Chinese sculptures, looted from Beijing centuries ago. \nHis crew is every heist archetype one can imagine—or at least, the closest he can get. A con artist: Irene Chen, a public policy major at Duke who can talk her way out of anything. A thief: Daniel Liang, a premed student with steady hands just as capable of lockpicking as suturing. A getaway driver: Lily Wu, an engineering major who races cars in her free time. A hacker: Alex Huang, an MIT dropout turned Silicon Valley software engineer. Each member of his crew has their own complicated relationship with China and the identity they\'ve cultivated as Chinese Americans, but when Will asks, none of them can turn him down. \nBecause if they succeed? They earn fifty million dollars—and a chance to make history. But if they fail, it will mean not just the loss of everything they\'ve dreamed for themselves but yet another thwarted attempt to take back what colonialism has stolen. \nEqual parts beautiful, thoughtful, and thrilling, Portrait of a Thief is a cultural heist and an examination of Chinese American identity, as well as a necessary critique of the lingering effects of colonialism.

He’s called upon to help an old friend, Mack Stafford, a former lawyer in Clanton, who three years earlier became a local legend when he stole money from his clients, divorced his wife, filed for bankruptcy, and left his family in the middle of the night, never to be heard from again—until now. Now Mack is back, and he’s leaning on his old pals, Jake and Harry Rex, to help him return. His homecoming does not go as planned. \nIn “Strawberry Moon,” we meet Cody Wallace, a young death row inmate only three hours away from execution. His lawyers can’t save him, the courts slam the door, and the governor says no to a last-minute request for clemency. As the clock winds down, Cody has one final request. \nThe “Sparring Partners” are the Malloy brothers, Kirk and Rusty, two successful young lawyers who inherited a once prosperous firm when its founder, their father, was sent to prison. Kirk and Rusty loathe each other, and speak to each other only when necessary. As the firm disintegrates, the resulting fiasco falls into the lap of Diantha Bradshaw, the only person the partners trust. Can she save the Malloys, or does she take a stand for the first time in her career and try to save herself? \nBy turns suspenseful, hilarious, powerful, and moving, these are three of the greatest stories John Grisham has ever told.

Set in the 2010s of Singapore, the story begins with protagonist, Saloma Salem, an entrepreneur who believes that her ethnicity has impeded her success in life. As a result, she steadfastly rejects her race and culture. \nThis strains her relationship with her mother who still lives alone in their small family flat. Determined to be independent, she leads a simple life despite Saloma’s generous allowance. Their fractious relationship breaks down when she forces her antiquated beliefs about a wife’s role on Saloma. The story tells how far Saloma would go to deny her culture, the efforts she takes to save her marriage and to maintain the image of a perfect life. But her plans go awry, forcing her to confront her own demons. Hannah used to be all about focus, back before she shattered her ankle and her Olympic dreams in one bad soccer play.

More than three decades of trade and investment with the advanced democracies have left that country far richer and stronger than it would otherwise have been. But growth and development have not caused China\'s rulers to relax their grip on political power, abandon their mercantilist economic policies, or accept the rules and norms of the existing international system. To the contrary: China today is more repressive at home, more aggressive abroad, and more obviously intent on establishing itself as the world’s preponderant power than at any time since the death of Chairman Mao. What went wrong? \nPut simply, the democracies underestimated the resilience, resourcefulness, and ruthlessness of the Chinese Communist Party. For far too long, the United States and its allies failed to take seriously the Party\'s unwavering determination to crush opposition, build national power, and fulfill its ideological and geopolitical ambitions. In this timely and powerfully argued study, Aaron Friedberg identifies the assumptions underpinning engagement, describes the counterstrategy that China\'s Communist Party rulers devised in order to exploit the West\'s openness while defeating its plans, and explains what the democracies must do now if they wish to preserve their prosperity, protect their security, and defend their common values.

What’s wrong with me? Is this all there is? Satya Doyle Byock hears these refrains regularly in her psychotherapy practice where she works with “Quarterlifers,” individuals between the ages of (roughly) sixteen to thirty-six. She understands their frustration. Some clients have done everything “right”: graduate, get a job, meet a partner. Yet they are unfulfilled and unclear on what to do next. Byock calls these Quarterlifers “Stability Types.” Others are uninterested in this prescribed path, but feel unmoored. She refers to them as “Meaning Types.” \nWhile society is quick to label the emotions and behavior of this age group as generational traits, Byock sees things differently. She believes these struggles are part of the developmental journey of Quarterlife, a distinct stage that every person goes through and which has been virtually ignored by popular culture and psychology. \nIn Quarterlife, Byock utilizes personal storytelling, mythology, Jungian psychology, pop culture, literature, and client case studies to provide guideposts for this period of life. Readers will be able to find themselves on the spectrum between Stability and Meaning Types, and engage with Byock’s four pillars of Quarterlife development. \nQuarterlife is a defining work that offers a compassionate roadmap toward finding understanding, happiness, and wholeness in adulthood.

This is because of the changing dynamics in the geopolitical sphere, governmental policies, and shifting societal beliefs and ideologies, all of which affect investment and consumption of goods and services, the main drivers of the global economy. The most difficult task of all is to build a common consensus, and disparities often occur even among the most diligent of economists. Chinese astrology has been taught and used in predicting economic events based on the understanding of the 5 energy elements that control our planet’s geophysics, thereby affecting certain sectors of the economy due to the presence of favourable and unfavourable energies that rule a particular day, month, or year. \nThrough this book, the authors hope to provide us with a glimpse of the future over the next 5 years based on their collective knowledge of Chinese astrology and understanding of prevalent geopolitical, economic, and financial trends that would exert themselves in the coming years. Tremendous amount of research have been done by the authors to help us understand today’s technology trends and how they will play significant roles in altering the way we live our lives in the future. They also discuss potential pivotal events that could reshape the geopolitical landscape in the coming years and have wide ramifications for future generations.

Throughout, a series of fascinating real-life case studies illustrate the traits that signify quality, as well as some that flatter to deceive. \nThe authors\' firm, AKO Capital, has a strong track record of finding and investing in quality companies - helping it deliver a compound annual growth rate more than double that of the market since inception.

He really is a revolutionary.”—Phil Knight, co-founder of Nike, author of Shoe Dog \nThe founder of The Charles Schwab Corporation recounts his ups and downs as he made stock investing, once the expensive and clubby reserve of the few, accessible to ordinary Americans. \nIn this deeply personal memoir, Schwab describes his passion to have Main Street participate in the growing economy as investors and owners, not only earners. Schwab opens up about his dyslexia and how he worked around and ultimately embraced it, and about the challenges he faced while starting his fledgling company in the 1970s. A year into his grand experiment in discounted stock trading, living in a small apartment in Sausalito with his wife, Helen, and new baby, he carried a six-figure debt and a pocketful of personal loans. As it turned out, customers flocked to Schwab, leaving his small team scrambling with scarce resources and no road map to manage the company’s growth. \nHe recounts the company’s game-changing sale to Bank of America—and how, in the end, the merger almost doomed his organization. We learn about the clever and timely leveraged buyout he crafted to regain independence; the crushing stock market collapse of 1987, just weeks after the company had gone public; the dot-com meltdown of 2000 and its reverberating aftermath of economic stagnation, layoffs, and the company’s eventual reinvention; and how the company’s focus on managing risk protected it and its clients during the financial crisis in 2008, propelling its growth. \nA remarkable story of a company succeeding by challenging norms and conventions through decades of change, Invested also offers unique insights and lifelong principles for readers—the values that Schwab has lived and worked by that have made him one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our time. Today, his eponymous company is one of the leading financial services firms in the world.

How to find what stocks to buy? How to obtain it? \nHungarian by birth, Nicolas Darvas trained as an economist at the University of Budapest. Reluctant to remain in Hungary until either the Nazis or the Soviets took over, he fled at the age of 23 with a forged exit visa and fifty pounds sterling to stave off hunger in Istanbul, Turkey. During his off hours as a dancer, he read some 200 books on the market and the great speculators, spending as much as eight hours a day studying. \nDarvas invested his money into a couple of stocks that had been hitting their 52-week high. He was utterly surprised that the stocks continued to rise and subsequently sold them to make a large profit. His main source of stock selection was Barron\'s Magazine. At the age of 39, after accumulating his fortune, Darvas documented his techniques in the book, How I Made 2,000,000 in the Stock Market. \nThe book describes his unique "Box System", which he used to buy and sell stocks. Darvas\' book remains a classic stock market text to this day. Darvas\' story is remarkable because he was able to achieve significant financial success in a relatively short period of time. However, his results may not be typical or easily replicable. The book primarily serves as a personal account of Darvas\' trading journey and the lessons he learned along the way.

And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published, readers will find that very little in the book itself has changed - and for good reason. While so much in our world is changing a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad Poor Dad haven\'t changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role in our daily lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki\'s international bestseller are more timely and more important than ever. \nMilestones \nWhile there is a milestone to commemorate - and a new section in the book on Why Milestones Are Important - preserving the integrity of the original content is testimony to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars throughout the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary edition) have been updated again, but the core principles that parents and grandparents - those who embraced Robert\'s story and messages 25 years ago - are sharing them with new generations who have found that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons can be applied to anyone\'s life and their vision for a future that includes taking control of their finances. \nPeople of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure time, mark progress, reflect on the lessons we\'ve learned, and celebrate accomplishments... and they give meaning to our life\'s journey. They are a way that we integrate past, present, and future... looking back at where we started, where we are today... and the promise of all that the future can hold.
